# About Me

*My name is Suditi Bhatt and I am junior at UC San Diego.*

One quote by Maria Klawe that I like about computer science is:
> Coding is today's language of creativity.

I used the commands `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push --all` to add changes to my page.

I used this [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links) for the formatting syntax for this page.
