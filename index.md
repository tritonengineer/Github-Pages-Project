# About Me

*My name is Suditi Bhatt and I am junior at UC San Diego.*

One quote by Maria Klawe that I like about computer science is:
> Coding is today's language of creativity.

I used the commands `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push --all` to add changes to my page.

I used this [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links) for the formatting syntax for this page.

Here is a link to a [headshot](HeadShot.png) of me!

Here is a list of languages I have learned about:
- Java
- C
- C++

Here are some UCSD CSE classes I have taken:
1. CSE 11
2. CSE 30
3. CSE 100

To graduate I have to take more CSE classes like:
- [ ] CSE 101
- [ ] CSE 120
- [ ] CSE 130
